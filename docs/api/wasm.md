# WebAssembly (Wasm) Integration with ScorpionJS

ScorpionJS embraces the power and potential of WebAssembly (Wasm) by providing tools and patterns for integrating Wasm modules into your applications. This allows you to run high-performance code written in languages like Rust, C++, Go, or C# directly within your ScorpionJS services.

## Overview

Leverage WebAssembly for computationally intensive tasks, to reuse existing codebases written in other languages, or to achieve near-native performance for critical sections of your application.

## Features

- **Wasm Module Loading**: Utilities for loading and instantiating Wasm modules within the ScorpionJS environment (Node.js, Deno, Bun, etc.).
- **Service Integration**: Seamlessly call functions exported by Wasm modules from your ScorpionJS services and hooks.
- **Data Marshaling**: Helpers for efficient data exchange between JavaScript/TypeScript and Wasm (e.g., converting complex objects, strings, and typed arrays).
- **Performance**: Execute performance-critical logic at near-native speeds.
- **Language Interoperability**: Write parts of your application in the best language for the job and integrate them via Wasm.
- **Sandboxing**: Wasm modules run in a sandboxed environment, providing a degree of security.
- **Tooling Recommendations**: Guidance on toolchains for compiling various languages to Wasm (e.g., `wasm-pack` for Rust, Emscripten for C/C++).

## Use Cases

- **High-Performance Computing**: Image/video processing, cryptography, complex simulations, data analysis.
- **Reusing Existing Libraries**: Utilize mature libraries written in C++, Rust, etc., without rewriting them in JavaScript.
- **Security-Sensitive Operations**: Perform sensitive operations in a more controlled Wasm environment.
- **Cross-Platform Code**: Write core logic once in a Wasm-compilable language and use it across different JavaScript runtimes supported by ScorpionJS.

## Example (Conceptual)

Imagine a Rust function compiled to Wasm for fast image processing:

```rust
// image_processor.rs (Rust code)
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn grayscale(image_data: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
    // ... image processing logic ...
    let mut processed_data = image_data.to_vec();
    // Example: simplified grayscale conversion
    for pixel in processed_data.chunks_mut(4) {
        let avg = ((pixel[0] as u16 + pixel[1] as u16 + pixel[2] as u16) / 3) as u8;
        pixel[0] = avg; // R
        pixel[1] = avg; // G
        pixel[2] = avg; // B
    }
    processed_data
}
```

In your ScorpionJS service:

```javascript
// image-service.js
import { createApp } from 'scorpionjs';
import { loadWasmModule } from 'scorpionjs-wasm-utils'; // Hypothetical utility

const app = createApp();

let imageProcessorWasm;

app.service('images', {
  async setup(app, path) {
    // Load the Wasm module during service setup
    imageProcessorWasm = await loadWasmModule('./path/to/image_processor.wasm');
  },

  async processImage(data, params) {
    if (!imageProcessorWasm) {
      throw new Error('Wasm module not loaded');
    }
    const imageData = data.buffer; // Assuming data.buffer is a Uint8Array or similar
    const processedImageData = imageProcessorWasm.grayscale(imageData);
    return { processedBuffer: processedImageData };
  }
});

// Start the app
app.listen(3000);
```

This example illustrates how you might load and call a Wasm module. ScorpionJS would provide robust utilities for `loadWasmModule` and data handling.
